In order for this code to work, be sure to uncheck the Forum Prefix box in bbPress, and set your Single Forum Slug to "forum"

**Attention!**

You need **manually flush rewrite rules** after activating bbPress and this plugin.Â You can do it by visiting `/wp-admin/options-permalink.php` page. Or use wp cli (`wp rewrite flush` command).
